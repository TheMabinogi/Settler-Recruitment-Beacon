### Latest Release

### Mod Description
Adds a new Settler Recruitment Beacon that bases it's recruitment on the number of Sim Settlement residential plots.  This allows a greater control over settlement populations and removes the maximum settler restriction.<br>

### Details
- Once per day the Settler Recruitment Beacon will attempt to recruit new settlers.<br>
- It will only do so if the number of Residential plots is greater than settler population.<br>
- Recruitment chance is based on the settlement happiness and players charisma.<br>

### Warnings
Fallout is not designed for very large settlements, recruiting too many settlers can impact performance and stability.  By using this mod you are responsible for finding a sensible limit for your system.  Generally keeping population between 30-50 settlers per settlement should be ok.<br>
