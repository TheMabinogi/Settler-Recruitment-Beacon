###Mod Description
Adds a new Settler Recruitment Beacon that bases it's recruitment on the number of Sim Settlement residential plots.
This allows a greater control over settlement populations and removes the maximum settler restriction.

###Details
Once per day the Settler Recruitment Beacon will attempt to recruit new settlers.
It will only attempt recruitment if the number of Sim Settlement residential plots is greater than current settler population.
Recruitment chance is based on the settlement happiness and players charisma.

###Warnings
Fallout is not designed for very large settlements, recruiting too many settlers can impact performance and stability.
By using this mod you are responsible for finding a sensible limit for your system.
Generally keeping population between 30-50 settlers per settlement should be ok.
It is recommended PC players use the ini settings outlined here : link
